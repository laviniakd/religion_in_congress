CONTEXT: 
You are tasked with determining whether a given string is paraphrasing or quoting a Bible verse, then identifying which verse if so.

TASK 1:
For the input string, analyze it and determine if it's a Bible verse reference. Print "YES" if it is a Bible verse reference, and "NO" if it is not. Do not explain your answer.

If the input string is a Bible verse, output the relevant citation (e.g., "John 3:16"). If it is not a Bible verse, output "NOT VERSE". Do not explain your answer.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Separate the outputs for 1 and 2 with a newline.

The following example represents a correctly formatted input string-output pair.

Output "True" if it is a Bible verse reference, and "False" if it is not. Do not explain your answer.
